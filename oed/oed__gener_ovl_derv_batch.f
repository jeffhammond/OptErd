C                                    1 and 2 in that order, for each
C                                    csh individually such that an
C                                    (I,J) element corresponds to the
C                                    I-th primitive and J-th contraction.
C                    CC(BEG)END   =  (lowest)highest nonzero primitive

C                                    1 and 2 in that order. They are
C                                    different from (1)NPGTOx only for
C                                    segmented contractions
C                    SPHERIC      =  is true, if spherical integrals
C                                    are wanted, false if cartesian
C                                    ones are wanted
C                    SCREEN       =  is true, if screening will be
C                                    done at primitive integral level
C                    ICORE        =  integer scratch space
